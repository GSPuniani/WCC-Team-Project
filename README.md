# Netflix Guide
<i>Make School SPD 1.3 Team Project</i>

Built by a team of Make School students, Netflix Guide is a new way to search and browse titles on Netflix. 

On Netflix Guide, users can search for titles across Netflix's entire global catalog. This allows users who circumvent regional restrictions with VPNs to see the country availability for each title. Additionally, users can see the audio and subtitle languages for each title in each country that it is available in to watch. 

Netflix Guide also presents two lists for titles available in the U.S.: Recently Added and Expiring Soon. Recently Added titles were added to Netflix in the past 90 days, and Expiring Soon titles are slated to leave Netflix within 1-2 months. Each title in the Expiring Soon list includes an expiration date.

## Back-end Technology

Netflix Guide uses the [unogsNG API](https://rapidapi.com/unogs/api/unogsng) for all of its data.
